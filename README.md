# 10 Days of React Challenges (Beginner) from scotch.io
#### [Link](https://scotch.io/courses/10-react-challenges-beginner/display-simple-data-with-jsx?autoplay=true)
#### Just some React.js practice to keep the skills sharp. Hopefully I'll be able to finish this in less than 10 days. The challenge is coded in codesandbox.io but I decided to do a CRA and make a repo to keep those green squares up. 

#### Components: I'm going to use React components for organization and cleanliness. Each challenge will be a different component that is rendered in App.js.

#### CSS: I'm using the CSS found in the codesandbox.io examples (follow link above then scroll to the bottom of any lesson and to find the codesandbox.io links)

### Here we go!

### Day 1
#### Display simple data with jsx

### Day 2
#### Loop over an array of data

### Day 3
#### update data from form input
I went a different route from the tutorial today but used the same general concepts of event listening and updating state. In the tutorial, Chris used React Hooks with a useState function, however, in my UpdateForm component, I assigned state directly and then used setState() to achieve a temporary update.
